<h1>MDWiki Lookup</h1>
MDWiki Lookup is a Chrome extension that detects medical terminology on the websites you visit. Terms are underlined, and hovering over them leads to a popup with information retrieved from MDWiki.org. Clicking on the underline directs you to the full MDWiki article.

The image below shows an example of the extension on an article in the New England Journal of Medicine. Hovering over the underlined word "hypoxemia" brings up a dialogue with information and images retrieved from MDWiki.org.

I am a medical student, not a programmer of any sorts. Most of this code was written by ChatGPT. Contributions by people who have great ideas or know what they are doing (unlike me) are strongly encouraged.
